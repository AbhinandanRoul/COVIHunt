# COVIHunt
A simple diagnostic tool to detect COVID-19 patients through their Lungs X-ray.

## Technical Details-
This Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model is helpful to detect COVID-19 positive patients based on their lungs X-Ray.
I have used Posteroanterior(PA) chest views to train the model. 
I've achieved an **Accuracy of 98%** in Validation Data.

## Dataset-
For COVID-19 Positive X-ray

## Caution-
This is just a project made out of interest. Clinical Accuracy isn't guaranteed.
